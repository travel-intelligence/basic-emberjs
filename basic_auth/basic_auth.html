        <h1>HTTP Auth with HTML forms</h1>
        <p>This page demonstrates using Javascript to add a HTML form interface to a HTTP Auth
        protected URL. <a href="/articles/http-auth-with-html-forms.html">A detailed discussion
        of this technique can be found here</a> and <a href="httpauth.js">the Javascript file that makes it all
        work is here</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The log out option is known not to work in Internet Explorer due
        to the way IE handles remembering incorrect auth credentials.</p>
        <p>To test this out, try accessing <a href="private.php">the protected resource</a> with
        correct and incorrect credentials, the username "user" and password "password" will let
        you in.</p>
