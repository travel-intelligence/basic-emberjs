    <h1>HTTP Auth with HTML forms</h1>
    <p>This page demonstrates using Javascript to add a HTML form
      interface to a HTTP Auth protected
      URL. <a href="/articles/http-auth-with-html-forms.html">A
	detailed discussion of this technique can be found here</a>
      and <a href="httpauth.js">the Javascript file that makes it all work is here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The log out option is known not to work
      in Internet Explorer due to the way IE handles remembering incorrect auth credentials.</p>
    <p>To test this out, try
      accessing <a href="https://travel-intelligence.com">the protected resource</a> with correct and incorrect credentials,
      the username "user" and password "password" will let you in.</p>
